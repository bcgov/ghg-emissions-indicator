## Appendix A: Breakdown of Economic Sectors

-   Economic sectors were broken down into subsectors, where subsectors were available. Further information on the emissions categorized in each subsector are provided in the [British Columbia Greenhouse Gas Provincial Inventory Methodology](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/environment/climate-change/data/provincial-inventory/2019/provincial_inventory_methodology_book_1990-2019.pdf)^2^.
-   Each subsector contributes varying amounts of emissions to the sector total. Examining these breakdowns further can give us a greater insight into the sources of emissions in B.C.
-   In each economic subsector figure below, the grey background shows the total emissions from each sector over time and the color sections show the contribution of each sub-sector compared to the sector total.
