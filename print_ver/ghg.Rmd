* **Greenhouse gas emissions warm the global atmosphere and cause our climate to change.** Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is a key component to limiting the increase in global average temperature and the resulting change in climate.
  
* **Total greenhouse gas emissions in `r max_ghg_yr` in B.C. were `r ghg_est_Mtco2e` million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent.** This is a `r abs(previous_year)`% increase in emissions since `r max_ghg_yr - 1` and a `r abs(baseline_year)`% `r ifelse(baseline_year > 0, "increase", "decrease")` in emissions since 2007---the Government of British Columbia's baseline year for assessing reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Greenhouse gas emission estimates reported here are from the [British Columbia Greenhouse Gas Emission Inventory (`r max_ghg_yr`)](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/climate-change/data/provincial-inventory)^1^ and do not include forest management offsets.

* **Greenhouse gas emissions per person are rising in recent years after declining for nearly two decades.** Greenhouse gas emissions per person in B.C. consistently declined from 2004 to 2015 but have been increasing since 2015.  Greenhouse gas emissions per unit gross domestic product---a measure of the size of the B.C. economy---have consistently declined over the past two decades. 
 
* **The transportation and fossil fuel industry produce the most greenhouse gas emissions in B.C.**  
Major transportation-related sources of greenhouse gas emissions include cars, trucks, heavy-duty trucks, and rail.  The major fossil fuel industry source is natural gas production and processing.

## Greenhouse Gas Emissions in British Columbia 

* In `r max_ghg_yr`, British Columbia emitted  `r abs(baseline_year)`% `r ifelse(baseline_year > 0, "more", "less")` greenhouse gases than the 2007 baseline year.

* Overall, the greenhouse gases produced per person in B.C.---also called per capita---were less in 2018 than the 2007 baseline year, however per capita emissions are increasing since 2015.

* Population size and gross domestic product in British Columbia have consistently increased since 2009, while greenhouse gas emissions have either stablized or increased by relatively small increments---compared to population and gross domestic product growth---during this same time period.

## Greenhouse Gas Emissions by Economic Sector

- Greenhouse gas emissions are sorted into the following economic sectors: fossil fuels, electricity, transportation, heavy industry, buildings, agriculture, waste, afforestation and deforestation, and other industry (includes light manufacturing, construction, and forest resources). 

- The transportation sector produces the largest amount of greenhouse gas emissions in British Columbia. Passenger transport including cars, trucks, motorcycles and freight transport, using heavy duty trucks and rail, produce the largest emissions of carbon dioxide equivalent. 

- The fossil fuel sector produces the second largest amount of greenhouse gas emissions in British Columbia. This sector includes energy production, refining and distribution activities.

## How have greenhouse gas emissions changed within economic sectors? 

- The amount of carbon dioxide equivalent emitted annually by each economic sector was compared to 1990. Sectors that have increased emissions from 1990 include transportation and fossil fuels. The largest increase in emissions over the past decade was in the transportation sector. The fossil fuel industry has also seen consistent increases in emissions, with levels peaking from 2011 to 2014. Buildings, agriculture, other industry, electricity and waste sectors emitted similar levels of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2018 as 1990. Deforestation and heavy industry emissions have declined from 1990. Deforestation emissions have declined consistently since 1990. Heavy industry has decreased annual emissions consistently from 2004 to 2013, with slight increases in recent years. 

- Each economic sector was broken down into more specific categories. This information is provided in Appendix A.

## Methods

British Columbia's total greenhouse gas emissions are estimated using the [British Columbia Greenhouse Gas Provincial Inventory Methodology](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/environment/climate-change/data/provincial-inventory/2018/bc_provincial_ghg_inventory_1990-2018_-_methodology_book.pdf)^2^, using data from provincial-level sources and [Canada's National Inventory Report](http://www.publications.gc.ca/site/eng/9.506002/publication.html).^3^ See the [British Columbia Greenhouse Gas Emission Inventory (2018)](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/climate-change/data/provincial-inventory)^1^ for details. Greenhouse gas emissions include carbon dioxide (CO~2~), methane (CH~4~), nitrous oxide (N~2~O), sulphur hexafluoride (SF~6~), perfluorocarbons (PFCs),  hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and nitrogen trifluoride (NF~3~) released by human activity---these emissions are reported collectively here as millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (Mt CO~2~e).  British Columbia population estimates ([Table: 17-10-0005-01](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1710000501)) and gross domestic product ([Table: 36-10-0222-01](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=3610022201)) data were sourced from [Statistics Canada](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/start). Gross domestic product (GDP) is calculated using expenditure-based GDP and reported in millions of chained 2012 dollars.

The **[R](http://www.r-project.org)** code for repeating the analysis and data visualizations presented on this page is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/bcgov/ghg-emissions-indicator).
